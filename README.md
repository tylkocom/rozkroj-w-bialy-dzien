# Nestings
## What are they?
Nestings are files (typically CSV files) that our factories use to help them manufacture and pack our furniture.

They are pretty flexible, but typical information would be: 
 - name/id of the element that will appear on a label printed by an integrated printer to identify element after cutting
 - dimensions of the element
 - material (either name of the material or code of the board in case of automated material storage systems)
 - additional info â€“ banding order, thickness, machine-specific options

We aim for our manufacturing process to be as automated as possible, 
so the files can be used i.e. to program the machines that cut the materials.

### IMPORTANT NOTE
This code is created especially for this task. The quality of the code does not reflect
the quality of the code that we would write in production.

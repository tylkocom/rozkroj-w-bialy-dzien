# Nestings
## What are they?
Nestings are files (typically CSV files) that our factories use to help them manufacture and pack our furniture.

They are pretty flexible, but typical information would be: 
 - dimensions of the element
 - pack in which it should be packed
 - in which order should it be packed (i.e. it's element 3/8 in this pack)
 - how to rotate the element on the given machine
 - where to position each corner of the material
 - thickness of the material

We aim for our manufacturing process to be as automated as possible, 
so the files can be used i.e. to program the machines that cut the materials.

### IMPORTANT NOTE
This code is created especially for this task. The quality of the code does not reflect
the quality of the code that we would write in production.
